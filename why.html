          Developing four skills together in one learning process, receptive skills, reading and listening as well as
          productive skills, writing, and speaking.

          Using both sides of the brain left and right which guarantee full results.

          Helping the learner to become fluent by time due to some special strategies that allow the brain to think in
          the
          target language and overcome the obstacle of translation.

          The ability to generate new sentences and acquire correct patterns by imitating the writing style of the story
          .at the eighth section expressing the images.

          Elevating self-confidence and enhancing auto-learning without neediness to an instructor.

          It is based on "the Natural Approach " which means imitating the same way that the brain follows in acquiring
          his mother tongue and focus on understanding messages in the foreign language, and place little or no
          importance
          on error correction, drilling, or on conscious learning of grammar rules. They also emphasize learning a wide
          vocabulary base over learning new grammatical structures.

          The process that is mentioned in the app based on the *theory of Noam Chomsky about LAD language acquisition
          device *which speaks about the natural mechanism that the brain follows to generate an infinite number of
          sentences just by providing the brain with correct patterns of sentences

          The way we put timing to take a break every 25 minutes let you stay focus for a much longer period which may
          reach 10 hours intensively. also, each break you take around 5 to 10 minutes allows your brain to make
          connections between each new information and an old one.

          In section of drilling on correct pronunciation we give the learner correct tap scripts to listen and attempt
          to
          imitate them each time he stops and correct his pronunciation. thus he follows the quickest way to pronounce
          correctly regardless of his familiarity with pronunciation rules

          In the section of expressing images, the learners could acquire immediately the style of writing by imitating
          the way that the writer follows to express the exact meaning through correct patterns of sentences.

          Providing the learner with the simplest as well as the much little amount of package that allows him to start
          mastering the English language as if you have been learning the language since many years ago.

          Letting the learner overcome the barriers of translating each sentence to his mother tongue and helping him to
          start thinking with the target language immediately after he finishes the first story. thus he will be ready
          to
          think like a native speaker.

          All strategies mentioned in Lansly app are put to train, and motivate the subconscious mind. thus the learning
          process would be highly effective.
